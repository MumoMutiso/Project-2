# Store Sales Review

Azubi store has products that customers love. Below are the products, prices and the number of customers that patronize each product last week.

The owner wants you to do some analysis on data with these criteria:

Calculate the total price average for all products
Create a new price list that reduces the old prices by GHC5
Calculate the total revenue generated from the products
Calculate the average daily revenue generated from the products
Based on the new prices, which products are less than GHC30
Below is the data you are to use for the problem:

products = ["Sankofa Foods", "Jamestown Coffee", "Bioko Chocolate", "Blue Skies Ice Cream", "Fair Afric Chocolate", "Kawa Moka Coffee", "Aphro Spirit", "Mensado Bissap", "Voltic"]
prices = [30, 25, 40, 20, 20, 35, 45, 50, 35]
last_week = [2, 3, 5, 8, 4, 4, 6, 2, 9]
